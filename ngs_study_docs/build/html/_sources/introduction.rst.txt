Introduction
============

This documentation offers a practical, easy-to-follow guide to the **Illumina DRAGENâ„¢ DNA Pipeline**, 
a hardware-accelerated platform designed for rapid and accurate secondary analysis of next-generation 
sequencing (NGS) data.

The DRAGEN DNA Pipeline dramatically reduces analysis time by leveraging FPGA-based acceleration. 
For example, processing a whole human genome at 30x coverage that can take 10+ hours with conventional 
software can be completed in under 30 minutes using DRAGEN.

This guide is designed for researchers, clinical bioinformaticians, and quality assurance teams who work with sequencing data, such as FASTQ or BAM files, for the detection of germline or somatic DNA variants.

It provides guidance on:

- Preparing input files and reference genomes
- Assessing the quality of raw sequencing reads
- Performing alignment and evaluating post-alignment quality
- Detecting single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions and deletions (INDELs), and copy number variants (CNVs)
- Interpreting alignment and variant calling metrics
- Reviewing and understanding output files generated by the DRAGEN DNA Pipeline

The content is based on **Illumina DRAGEN v3.8**, with a focus on practical usage, standard quality control checkpoints, and commonly supported DNA sequencing workflows such as:

- Whole genome sequencing (WGS)
- Whole exome sequencing (WES)
- Targeted gene panels

All recommendations follow Illumina best practices, supporting reproducible, high-quality DNA analysis using the DRAGEN platform.
